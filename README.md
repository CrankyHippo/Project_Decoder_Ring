# Decoder Ring

Learning objectives
This project was designed to test my ability to build complex algorithms. Also to test my ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test my algorithms.

## Objectives
* Writing a series of unit tests using Mocha and Chai
* Using different expect() methods to test your code
* Create 3 ciphers

### [Caesar Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher, one of the most easy and most famous encryption systems. It uses the substitution of a letter by another one further in the alphabet.

### [Polybius Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square)

Invented by the ancient Greeks Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and made famous by the historian and scholar Polybius. The device is used for fractionating plaintext characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols, which is useful for telegraphy, steganography, and cryptography. The device was originally used for fire signalling, allowing for the coded transmission of any message, not just a finite amount of predetermined options as was the convention before.

### [Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)

The substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the "units" may be single letters, pairs of letters, triplets of letters, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution process to extract the original message.
